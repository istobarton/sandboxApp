Isto's work for Sandbox App

Initial notes - 
-too much white space
-phone image too small 
-Sandbox image not truly centered over content
-Sidebar has too few options to justify taking up so much space
-Fonts are not in their own font
-Text not centered within < >
-Text Within “Content” Divs too small
-subtitle style not in line
-“Would you like to get notifications”
-boxes too large for App Content


Ideas - 
-Remove Nav bar for 4 options up top (not within constraints of project)
	-Move Nav Bar to top
-Provide options for viewing app in different devices — 
	-initialize with a much larger rendering.
-On hovering over a specific section “text style” highlight where that appears in app
-More descriptive titles for content creation
-Add Back button
-Represent Name and Subtext above image of app

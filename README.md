##Isto's work for Sandbox App

"So the project we're going to have you work on is redesigning a few screens for an existing application editor. A few guidelines would be to utilize the sidebar area to improve the flow of the user experience and to don't be afraid to overhaul the entire workflow design. I've attached a branding guidelines png. as well!"

If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask. We'll be expecting these by COB Monday!"

#Initial notes - 
- too much white space
- phone image too small 
- Sandbox image not truly centered over content
- Sidebar has too few options to justify taking up so much space
- Fonts are not in their own font
- Text not centered within < >
- Text Within “Content” Divs too small
- subtitle style not in line
- “Would you like to get notifications”
- boxes too large for App Content


#Ideas - 
- Remove Nav bar for 4 options up top (not within constraints of project)
	- Move Nav Bar to top
- Provide options for viewing app in different devices — 
	- initialize with a much larger rendering.
- On hovering over a specific section “text style” highlight where that appears in app
- More descriptive titles for content creation
- Add Back button
- Represent Name and Subtext above image of app


#Notes as I work - 
-Styling Guide font mispelled. Font source: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Rajdhani
-Don't forget you have glyphcons available
-Make sure you add issues at 4PM and write out next steps
-Add contact information to footer
-Does this need to adjust the content within the APP image? Or is this just styling? Adjust for timing.
-Are the '<>' on the user input form actual tags or images?
